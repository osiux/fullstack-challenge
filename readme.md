# React App Skeleton

## What is this?

I don't want to spend much time with the initial setup for a React app, so this is the skeleton with all the utilities I like to have.

## What does it include?

- Typescript
- TailwindCSS
- Emotion with tailwind macro
- Jest
- Eslint
- Prettier
- Separate Webpack conf for prod/dev
